Stroke is one of the most serious health issues today, often leading to long-term disability or even death 
if not detected early. The faster a stroke is diagnosed, the better the chances are for effective treatment 
and recovery. However, traditional methods like physical exams and brain scans can sometimes take 
time and may depend heavily on the doctor's judgment. 
To help with this, we decided to build a machine-learning model that can detect strokes more quickly 
and accurately. Our project uses deep learning techniques, with a special focus on the ReLU (Rectified 
Linear Unit) activation function. ReLU is commonly used in neural networks because it's fast, simple, 
and helps the model learn patterns more effectively, especially in large and complex medical data. 
The goal of our project is to create a smart system that can support doctors by analyzing patient data 
and predicting the possibility of a stroke. In this paper, we explain how we designed and trained our 
model, how it works, and how well it performs when tested on real data
